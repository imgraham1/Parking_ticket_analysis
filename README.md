# Parking_ticket_analysis
This project explores the intriguining question of whether or not parking ticket issuing frequency has any relationship with the type of weather. Here, I look at 10 years worth of parking ticket data in Chicago and have a total of over 11 million records. I also have the temperature, precipitation, and weather type for the same time period.

To answer this question, I used a combination of SQL, Spark, and Hadoop to work with the big dataset and query it for the information that I was interested in.
